# scorebot
IRC score bot for NFL/NBA/NHL

Concept
An IRC bot that will return scores for major league games in chat to keep you up to date!

TODOs
- Have the bot auto-push a message to the channel with a game has ended showing the final score
- Add support to 'watch' a game and push messages on a per half/quarter/goal basis
- Add support for aliases for each team ('TB', 'Tampa Bay', 'lightning', etc...)
- Add support for NBA feed
- Find more efficient way to distinguish between leagues for score reporting (e.g. !score pitt returns all league teams scores for pittsburgh-based teams)
- Add support for a user to add a 'favorite team' so !score can trigger and return their fav. teams without having to type it out every time
